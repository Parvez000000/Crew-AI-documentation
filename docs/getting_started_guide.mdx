# Getting Started Guide
The workdir/ML-Models project is a machine learning project that contains a Jupyter notebook file `bird-prediction-1.ipynb`. This guide will provide a step-by-step introduction on how to get started with the project, including setting up the environment and running the code.

## Introduction
The project is designed to be easy to use and understand. The `bird-prediction-1.ipynb` file contains code examples that demonstrate how to use the project.

## Prerequisites
Before starting with the project, you need to have a basic understanding of machine learning concepts.

## Setup Instructions
To set up the environment, you need to have Node.js and a package manager like npm or pnpm installed. You can use volta to manage node versions.

### Install Dependencies
To install the dependencies, run the following command:
npm install
or
pnpm install

### Run the Code
To run the code, navigate to the directory containing the `bird-prediction-1.ipynb` file and run:
jupyter notebook
This will start the Jupyter notebook server and open the notebook in your default web browser.

## Code Examples
The `bird-prediction-1.ipynb` file contains code examples that demonstrate how to use the project. You can run the cells in the notebook to see the output.

### Mermaid Diagrams
To visualize the component relationships and flows, we can use Mermaid diagrams. Here is an example of a Mermaid diagram that shows the workflow of the project:
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Data Loading] --> B[Data Preprocessing]
    B --> C[Model Training]
    C --> D[Model Evaluation]
    D --> E[Model Deployment]
```
This diagram shows the workflow of the project, from data loading to model deployment.

## Conclusion
In this guide, we have provided a step-by-step introduction on how to get started with the workdir/ML-Models project. We have covered the setup instructions, code examples, and Mermaid diagrams. With this guide, you should be able to run and test the code.
