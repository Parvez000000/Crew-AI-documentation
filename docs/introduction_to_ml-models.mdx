# Introduction to ML-Models
The ML-Models project is designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to machine learning models. The project's goal is to enable users to understand the fundamentals of machine learning and implement models using Python.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following sections:
- `bird-prediction-1.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook file containing code examples and explanations for building a bird prediction model.

## Setup Instructions
To set up the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies, including Jupyter Notebook and Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.
3. Open the `bird-prediction-1.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook to explore the code examples and explanations.

## Code Examples
The `bird-prediction-1.ipynb` file contains code examples for building a bird prediction model. The code is organized into sections, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('bird_data.csv')

# Preprocess the data
X = df.drop('species', axis=1)
y = df['species']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a random forest classifier
clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy:.3f}')
```

## Component Interactions
The project's components interact as follows:
