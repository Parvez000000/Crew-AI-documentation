# Component Interactions
The ML-Models project consists of several components that interact with each other to achieve the goal of bird prediction. The main components are:
* `bird-prediction-1.ipynb`: This is the core component of the project, responsible for training and testing the machine learning model.
* `README.md`: This file contains information about the project, including its purpose, dependencies, and usage instructions.

## Component Interactions
The components interact with each other through APIs and interfaces. The `bird-prediction-1.ipynb` component uses the `README.md` file to retrieve information about the project and its dependencies.

### APIs and Interfaces
The `bird-prediction-1.ipynb` component uses the following APIs and interfaces to interact with other components:
* `load_data()`: This function loads the dataset used for training and testing the model.
* `train_model()`: This function trains the machine learning model using the loaded dataset.
* `test_model()`: This function tests the trained model using a separate dataset.

### Mermaid Diagram
The following mermaid diagram illustrates the component interactions:

### Setup Instructions
To set up the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository using `git clone`.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the `bird-prediction-1.ipynb` component using `jupyter notebook`.

### Code Examples
The following code snippet from `bird-prediction-1.ipynb` illustrates the loading of the dataset:
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('dataset.csv')
```
